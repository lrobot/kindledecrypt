Kindle Book Decrypter
=====================
A simple GUI to remove the restrictions put in place to prevent copying books,
listening to some books, or transfering books to other devices, etc. All it
requires it the original book file and your Kindle serial number.

 * Backup your purchased Kindle books on your own media
 * Use other e-reading devices and/or software to read your purchased books
 * Re-enable audio playback of books that have disabled it
 * Allow a friend to borrow a book you are no longer reading (if this falls
   under fair use and is legal where you live)
 * Supports Mobipocket and Topaz book formats (azw, mobi, prc, azw1, tpz)
